# Text Processing

Class to process strings. The following processing functions are available:

1. `tokenize`: returns the tokens of the string as a list.
2. `lemmatize`: returns the lemmas of the string as a list.

Both functions have a boolean argument called `filter`. If it is set to True, as is the default, stopwords and punctuation signs are removed.

The file `example.py` contains an example of how to run it. Follow the installation instructions in the docstring.
